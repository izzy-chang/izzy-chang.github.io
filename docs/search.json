I managed methane tanks, handled eucalyptus samples, and filmed each burn to caputre data for later analysis.\n\n\nVernal Pool Restoration Lab Assistant – D’Antonio Lab\nIn this role, I worked independently in a molecular lab setting to run PCR tests on environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. I practiced careful pipetting and sterile techniques while operating the thermocycler to help indentify species present in vernal pool ecosystems."
