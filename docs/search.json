My group chose to answer the questions: “What have been\nthe historical greatest threats to wildlife corridors and which ecoregions in California have the most threatened wildlife corridors?” We created three different maps for three wildlife connectivity levels. Each of the maps have threat layers of movement barriers, fires, drought, human development, and logging, all projected onto an ecoregions map of California. We found the maximum threat for each ecoregion for each connectivity layer, along with the cumulative threats within habitat corridors to find the hotspots of which ecoregions have the most threats in each connectivity layer.\n\nArcGIS Pro StoryMap"

We were given a local location, East More Mesa in Goleta, and tasked with creating a Restoration Master Plan to help restore native plants and eradicate non-native species with a $500,000 hypothetical budget. We researched the background of the area, conducted a site visit to look at the hydrology, topography, fauna, flora, and other factors. We used transects to identify plant species and substrate types around the location. Finally, we created a plan for restoration of the area."
