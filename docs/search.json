    "text": "Isla Vista Surfrider\nAs Chair of the Ocean Friendly Restaurants Committee, I work with local restaurant owners and UCSB dining staff to help make more sustainable choices in food service. I recruit new Ocean Friendly Restaurants, support the ones already on board, and lead annual projects focused on sustainability in our local community and on campus. This year, we notably expanded the registered restaurant list in Santa Barbara to include Woodstocks, Oat Bakery, Santa Barbara Fish Market, and Backyard Bowls. We also recently got all of the UCSB campus dining halls OFR-certified, becoming the third university to do this. I run our committee meetings and help guide the team’s direction. I also interview and select new members to keep the committee growing and strong.\ninsert link to OFRs\nCamp Kesem at UCSB\nAs Development Coordinator, I help lead fundraising efforts to support kids whose parents have been affected by cancer – with the goal of giving them a free and unforgettable summer camp experience. I meet weekly with the leadership team to stay aligned on goals, and I build connections with community members and donors to keep our mission moving forward. I help plan and run fundraising events throughout the year, including a Giving Tuesday campaign where we raised over $45,000 in one day. So far, we have blown past our annual goal of $70,000 – raising over $100,000.\ninsert classy link insert amazon wishlist link insert pictures\nUCSB Facilities Management\nIn this role, I help keep things running behind the scenes by processing purchase orders, receiving shipments, and delivering supplies around campus. I regularly work with vendors and campus tradesmen to keep everything organized and on track. I also help organize past maintenance request tickets by creating visual trends with the data to help the departments better understand where resources are going.\nMAYBE insert example data sheets"
