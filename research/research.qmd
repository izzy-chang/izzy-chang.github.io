I completed an Honors Senior Thesis in the Environmental Studies department. The thesis is titled: "'Powerful Knowledges of Resistance': Listening to Women of Color Feminism in Environmental Justice Movements." With this thesis, I won the UCSB Library Award for Undergraduate Research and received Distinction in the Major.

## Lab Assistant Work

### Marine Parasite Lab -- Kuris Lab

In the Kuris Lab, I assisted with the dissection of octopuses to study marine parasites. I independently analyzed organs to identify infections from *Aggregata* species and helped maintain detailed records, including data entry and photo documentation. I also took care of octopus husbandry, including feeding, cleaning tanks, and monitoring the animals' health on a regular basis.

### Plant Flammability Lab -- D'Antonio Lab

While working in the Plant Flammability lab, I collected and recorded plant traits like weight and water potential, and helped carry out experimental burns to study fire behavior. I managed methane tanks, handled eucalyptus samples, and filmed each burn to caputre data for later analysis.

### Vernal Pool Restoration Lab Assistant -- D'Antonio Lab

In this role, I worked independently in a molecular lab setting to run PCR tests on environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. I practiced careful pipetting and sterile techniques while operating the thermocycler to help indentify species present in vernal pool ecosystems.
