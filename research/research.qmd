## Lab Assistant Work

### Marine Parasite Lab -- Kuris Lab

In the Kuris Lab, I assisted with the dissection of octopuses to study marine parasites. I independently analyzed organs to identify infections from *Aggregata* species and helped maintain detailed records, including data entry and photo documentation. I also took care of octopus husbandry, including feeding, cleaning tanks, and monitoring the animals' health on a regular basis.

### Plant Flammability Lab -- D'Antonio Lab

While working in the Plant Flammability lab, I collected and recorded plant traits like weight and water potential, and helped carry out experimental burns to study fire behavior. I managed methane tanks, handled eucalyptus samples, and filmed each burn to caputre data for later analysis.

### Vernal Pool Restoration Lab Assistant -- D'Antonio Lab

In this role, I worked independently in a molecular lab setting to run PCR tests on environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. I practiced careful pipetting and sterile techniques while operating the thermocycler to help indentify species present in vernal pool ecosystems.

## UCSB Library Award for Undergraduate Research

With my Environmental Studeis Honors Senior Thesis, I won the UCSB Library Award for Undergraduate Research in the Social Sciences category! This award recognizes students who have made expert use of the resources of services at the UCSB library to produce creative or scholarly work. My thesis is now published on eScholarship, which is accessible through the UC Library Reserve system.
