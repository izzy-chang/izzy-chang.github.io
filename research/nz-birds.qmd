This is a research paper for my BIOL 328 (Behaviour and Conservation Ecology) course when I was abroad at Victoria University of Wellington. For this, we went to a fenced ecosanctuary called Zealandia and a non-fenced area outside of Zealandia. We used distance sampling to compare population densities of three different bird species inside and outside of the fenced sanctuary to test the effectiveness of the fences.
