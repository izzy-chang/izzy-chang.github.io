This is a group project for ENV S 133 (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology). We were given a local location, East More Mesa in Goleta, and tasked with creating a Restoration Master Plan to help restore native plants and eradicate non-native species with a \$500,000 hypothetical budget. We researched the background of the area, conducted a site visit to look at the hydrology, topography, fauna, flora, and other factors. We used transects to identify plant species and substrate types around the location. Finally, we created a plan for restoration of the area.
